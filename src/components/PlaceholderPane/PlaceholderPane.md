# PlaceholderPane

The `PlaceholderPane` is used as a placeholder when a component is empty for some reason.

Some examples:
- Replacing a `ListView` when there are not items to list.
- Replacing a view when the user has filtered items and there are no items to render.
- Replacing a view when an error has occurred and data can't be shown.

## Guidelines
- Always use a short `text`.
- Provide a detailed description as `subText`.
- `text` doesn't end with full stop (.)
- `subText` ends with full stop (.)
